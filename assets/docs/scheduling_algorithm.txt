Scheduling Algorithm Documentation
===============================

Overview:
The scheduling system employs a constraint-based approach to maximize time slot utilization while maintaining physician schedules and ensuring timely patient appointments.

Key Features:
1. Time Slot Management
2. Doctor Availability Checks
3. Conflict Prevention

Algorithm Description:
1. Initialize doctor's schedule with working hours and max appointments
2. Generate time slots in 30-minute intervals for each working day
3. For each new appointment request:
   a. Validate doctor availability
   b. Check for time slot conflicts
   c. Verify maximum daily appointments
   d. If all checks pass, book appointment
4. Maintain appointment state:
   a. Track booked, cancelled, and rescheduled appointments
   b. Update available time slots accordingly

Algorithm Benefits:
- Efficient time slot management with O(log n) search complexity
- Real-time conflict detection and prevention
- Optimal resource utilization through constraint-based scheduling

Conflict Prevention Strategies:
1. Doctor Availability Check: Confirms doctor is scheduled for selected date
2. Working Hours Validation: Ensures appointment falls within doctor's shift
3. Double Booking Prevention: Prevents overlapping time slot reservations
